# Jets Rails for Mega Mode

This gem works in conjuction with Jets to allow you to run a Rails application on AWS Lambda. This gem is not meant to be used standalone.  Instead, jets automatically adds this gem to a Rails application as part of [Mega Mode Rails Support](http://rubyonjets.com/docs/rails-support/).

## Usage

This gem is not meant to be used standalone. You can enable it though by adding to your Rails Gemfile and setting the `JETS_MEGA=1` env var.
